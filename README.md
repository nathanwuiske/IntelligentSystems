# Intelligent System Assignments

* N-Queens: This assignment is based on solving the n-queens problem using the Hill-climbing search, Random re-start hill climbing search, Simulated annealing search and Genetic algorithm search.
* Neural Network: This assignment is based on implementing a machine learning algorithm, a Neural Network using Python. Datasets are provided to train and test the neural network which are experiemented with different settings of hyper parameters. The datasets are based on the MNIST hand written digits database.
